This is gpg4win - the GUI Installer Builder for W32.

See also the file doc/README.en.txt.

For MSI Package instructions see src/README-msi.txt.

Instructions:
=============

1. Download the source and binary packages that are required to build
   the installer:

   $ cd packages
   $ sh download.sh
   [...]
   $ cd ..

1.5 (Only necessary when building from Git)

   $ ./autogen.sh

2. Configure the source tree for cross compilation:

   $ ./autogen.sh --build-w32

3. Build the installer:

   $ make

The installer will be made available under src/installers:

src/installers/gpg4win-X.Y.Z.exe


Instructions for AppImage:
==========================

1. (Only necessary when building from Git)

   $ ./autogen.sh

2. Build the Docker image that will be used for creating the AppImage:

   $ docker/build-appimage-docker-image.sh

3. Build the AppImage using the Docker image:

   $ docker/run-appimage-build.sh


Basic requirements
==================

A decent POSIX system is required for building this software as well
as GNU make.  We are using Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster), any other
POSIX system should work as well but you may run into problems due to
different toolchain versions. For MSI Packages you will additionally
need the dependencies mentioned in src/README-msi.txt

To satisfy all needs of configure at least the following packages need
to be installed:

    build-essential autoconf automake mingw-w64 mingw-w64-i686-dev \
    mingw-w64-x86-64-dev nsis stow unzip icoutils texlive \
    libglib2.0-dev gettext docbook-utils ghostscript \
    texinfo libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev texlive-latex-extra libqt4-dev-bin \
    wget mingw-w64 texlive-lang-german cmake libgtk2.0-bin libxml2-utils \
    gperf libgettextpo-dev automake-1.15 libkf5config-dev libkf5config-dev-bin \
    libkf5coreaddons-dev gpgrt-tools imagemagick

Building the Webpages
=====================

The website is in the dedicated branch "website" in the git reposity.
Checkout that branch and read the instructions:

  git checkout website


Development Branches
====================

The old version of gpg4win (version < 1.2) is since 1.1.3 tracked by
the GIT branch: gpg4win-1-branch.  Only important fixes will go into
this version.  The current version in the GIT master starts as version
1.9.



Adding new packages to the installer:
=====================================

This requires editing a couple of files; we might eventually automate
some of these tasks.  Here is a short run up:

1. Add constants for the package FOO into src/config.nsi.in .

2. Create 2 new installer scripts, named src/inst-foo.nsi and
   uninst-foo.nsi and add them to EXTRA_DIST in src/Makefile.am.

3. Add foo to one the variables gpg4win_bpgks (if foo should not be
   build be the gpg4win) or gpg4win_spkgs (if foo should be build by
   gpg4win) in src/Makefile.am .  Also add any required configure
   flags etc.

4. Add FOO to src/inst-sections.nsi.

5. Add detection of packages to configure.ac.  Check out the available
   macros in m4/gpg4win.m4.  Depending on the way an upstream package
   is packaged, you might need to write a new macro.

6. Add download information to packages/download.sh.

7. If the package ships pkg-config (*.pc) support files, you need add
   post install instructions to Makefile.am.  Note that *.pc files may
   be in the "runtime" directory ${pkgidir} if the package is built
   within gpg4win (or peculiarly shipped), or in the development
   package ${pkgidir_dev}.

8. Add the installed files to the mkportable headers.

Then run the usual "./autogen.sh" to create the actual configure file
and run configure as described above.

Kleopatra Locatization
======================

The kde-l10n package is generated with the script src/kde-l10n.sh
execute it after a build to generate an updated l10n package which
you can then upload and add to packages.current.
The tarballs and the nsis scripts are located in the temp directory
kde-l10n prints as output.


Installer Slideshow
===================

During installation we are showing a slide show. If you want to
change the contents shown add / modify files in the src/slideshow
subfolder. Install them in inst-gpg4win.nsi (Add them to the list
of files before g4wihelp::slide_show) and modify
src/slideshow/slides.dat accordingly.

Version numbers
===============

We use a specific order of version numbers.  This is best shown by an
example:

  2.1.1             - The final 2.1.1 release.
  2.1.1-beta88      - A snapshot before the 2.1.1 release.
                      (The 88 in this example is the number of
                       commits since the last release).

The important point is that we bump up the version number before we do
an release and append a suffix to mark it as a development version.
This allows other software to use a configure check for the next to be
released version of gpg4win.
